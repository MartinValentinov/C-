# My First Steps in C++

## Overview
This repository contains my **first experiments and projects in C++**.  
It documents my journey learning C++, from simple programs to slightly more advanced exercises.

## About

This repo showcases:

- Basic C++ syntax: variables, loops, and conditions  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Classes and object-oriented programming concepts  
- Pointers, references, and memory management  
- Simple file I/O  
- Small projects and exercises to practice C++ fundamentals  
- Compiling and debugging C++ programs on macOS/Linux

It is primarily a **learning playground** to understand how C++ works.

## How to Compile and Run

You can compile the programs using `g++` or `clang++`. Examples:

```bash
# Compile a single C++ program
g++ -o hello_world src/hello_world.cpp
./hello_world

# Compile a multi-file program
g++ -o my_program src/main.cpp src/utils.cpp
./my_program
```
