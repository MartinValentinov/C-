You are asked to implement a program that reads two points from an input file and uses them to define a rectangle.

Constraints

The two points do not lie on a horizontal or vertical line, so a valid rectangle can be determined.

Program Requirements

Input

Read two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) from an input file.

Calculations

Compute the perimeter and area of the rectangle.

Write these results to output1.txt.

Drawing the Rectangle

Draw the rectangle in output2.txt using the following symbols

. → corners

- → horizontal sides

 → vertical sides

Notes

You may assume integer coordinates for simplicity.

The rectangle should be axis-aligned with sides parallel to the axes.
